This is the code of paper **Parameter Transfer Extreme Learning Machine based on Projective Model**

To reproduce the experiment in paper, you should first uncompress *rcv1rcv2aminigoutte.7z* file under data folder and then run
```
python run_text.py
```

**NOTE:** *rcv1rcv2aminigoutte.7z* is part of **Reuters RCV1/RCV2 Multilingual, Multiview Text Categorization Test collection** dataset download from [here](http://ama.liglab.fr/~amini/DataSets/Classification/Multiview/ReutersMutliLingualMultiView.htm) and modified for experiment necessary.
